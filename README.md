# COMP5424 Group 3 — Campus Emergency Preparedness

A VR fire evacuation preparedness practice prototype for international students at fictional Harbourview University. The experience supports practice rather than formal assessment and does not replace official emergency training.

## Current campus scene

Open `Assets/Scenes/TeachingBuildingCampus.unity` in Unity **2022.3.62f3**. This is the current campus environment, with scanned PBR surfaces, HDRI daylight, classroom furniture, physical signage, noticeboards, an articulated student and an optional localized smoke/alarm preview. Press **F4/F2** to walk and **V** to switch first/third person. Both evacuation routes support tested desktop stair ascent/descent; headset performance remains unverified.

Open [the standalone campus preview](Docs/Previews/Campus/TeachingBuildingCampusPreview.html) without Unity, or read [campus scene instructions](Docs/TeachingBuildingCampus.md). Current Unity captures and validation reports are in `Docs/Previews/Campus`; earlier material comparisons are in `Docs/Previews/Campus/History`.

## Earlier scene versions

- **Prototype:** `Assets/Scenes/TeachingBuilding.unity`; [instructions](Docs/TeachingBuildingPrototype.md), [browser preview](Docs/Previews/TeachingBuildingPreview.html).
- **Refined:** `Assets/Scenes/TeachingBuildingRefined.unity`; [instructions](Docs/TeachingBuildingRefined.md), [rendering fixes](Docs/TeachingBuildingRenderingAudit.md), [browser preview](Docs/Previews/Refined/TeachingBuildingRefinedPreview.html).

These versions remain available for iteration history. Campus still shares textures and generation helpers with Refined. Keep the scene lighting folders and the shared assets when distributing the Unity project.

## Project maintenance

See [file organization and cleanup](Docs/ProjectFileAudit.md) and [the cleanup record](Docs/ProjectCleanupCandidates.json). Unity caches, logs and generated IDE project files are excluded by `.gitignore`.
